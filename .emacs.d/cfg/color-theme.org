* Color Theme Configuration
  Use the color-theme-based solarized. There are other implementations that
  use load-theme, however, I don't like the faces and mode-line changes

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (use-package color-theme
    :ensure t
    :config
    (color-theme-initialize))

  (use-package color-theme-solarized
    :ensure t
    :config
    (color-theme-solarized))

  #+END_SRC
