* My Emacs Config
  This is my emacs configuration which is written as a set of org-mode files
  and loaded via ~org-babel-load-file~. I have a single top-level file for
  general config and I like to split mode-specific config into their own
  files, sometimes just with a simple ~use-package~ call to load the mode. I
  do this to because it fits with my source control workflow when adding
  subsequent mode config. It also helps me to remember which modes I have
  configured and helps remind me to remove config for modes I am no longer
  using. I have a small function to generate a list of the mode-specific
  config files an add them into the main emacs.org file dynamically when I
  edit the top-level file. Not a perfect system but good enough for me.

  - Bootstrap elisp file is here: [[file:.emacs]]
  - Literate config starts here: [[file:.emacs.d/emacs.org]]
  - Mode-specific configs are here: [[file:.emacs.d/cfg/]]
